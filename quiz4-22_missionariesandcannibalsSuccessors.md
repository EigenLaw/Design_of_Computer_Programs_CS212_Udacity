## Prof Norvvig's Note for the video
### Note: After we shot this video, we noticed there is a bug in the solution. The successor function correctly checks to make sure that there are not more cannibals than missionaries in a successor state, but it allows states with a negative numbers of people. We decided not to re-shoot the video, to remind you that everyone makes mistakes, and you should write more tests. This also gives you a chance to write the correct version of the solution yourself. ### 

Vector addition code - will be useful in General !!
